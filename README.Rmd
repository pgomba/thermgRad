## Tools to visualize and analyze germination in temperature gradient plates

![](images/head_title.png)

`thermgRad` package aims to provide with tools to visualize and analyze germination experiments conducted using a temperature gradient plate (TGP) with a bidirectional setting (day/night cycle) and obtain cardinal temperatures for each of the temperature fluctuations thresholds across the thermal gradient plate.

## Installation

You can install the development version of thermgRad from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r}
#install.packages("devtools")
#devtools::install_github("pgomba/thermgRad") 
library(thermgRad)
```

## What data does the package require?

Temperature: `thermgRad` needs average day and night corner temperatures. These are better recorded with an external temperature logger, since temperatures on the top side of the plate differ from those used in the TGP settings. If possible, I think is better to record corner temperatures in the center of each corner Petri dish (either log the temperature before or after the experiment). But `thermgRad` provides the necessary tools to transform corner temperatures to corner Petri dish center temperatures (which depends on Petri dish cover radio).

Germination: `thermgRad` requires, for each Petri dish:

-   Petri dish ID

-   Cumulative germination

-   Total number of seeds in the Petri dish (germinated + moldy + viable after cut test)

-   Day for each germination record

The data frame format containing all this information is a bit restrictive, but an example to how it should be formatted prior to load the data frame can be seen running the following code:

```{r,eval = FALSE}
View(thermgRad::tg_example)
```

## Functions

### How is T~50~ calculated?

T~50~ values are obtained via `thermgRad::coolbear`, a function adapting Coolbear et al. (1984) formula modified by Farooq et al.(2005).

</center>
where N represents the number of sowed seeds (germinated + viable + moldy) from a single replicate in all the experiments and n~i~ and n~j~ are the number of seeds germinated adjacently to (N/2) at time t~i~ and t~j~ respectively.
An example:
```{r}
scoring_days<-c(seq(1,20,2))
cumulative_germination<-c(0,0,0,6,7,12,18,23,23,23)
total_seeds<-25

thermgRad::coolbear(scoring_days,cumulative_germination,total_seeds) #Outputs T50
```
Among other things, `thermgRad::petri_grid` loops `thermgRad::coolbear` all over the template data frame to obtain T~50~ values for each Petri dish 

### Visualizing your experiment

`thermgRad::plot_results` collects your experiments results and temperatures and collects them on a Day/Night graph. It´s possible to choose between showing average Petri dish temperature, average temperature fluctuation and germination with parameter `toplot= "average`,`toplot= "fluctuation`or`toplot= "germina"`. 
```{r, fig.width=6.5,fig.height=6.5}
data<-thermgRad::tg_example
thermgRad::plot_results(data, 0,0,40,40,0,40,0,40, petri=13, toplot= "germina")
```
Input `?plot_results` in the R console for a list of parameters. `0,0,40,40,0,40,0,40` refers to corner temperatures. The first four number belong to daytime temperatures (Bottom left, Bottom right, Top left and Top right) followed by nighttime temperatures (again, Bottom left, Bottom right, Top left and Top right). `thermgRad:plot_results` assumes you want to use average temperature between corners (e.g. If during daytime the bottom left corner runs at 5°C, and the bottom right corner runs at 8°C, the function will use 6.5°C). Enabling `method="precise"` within the function creates a more accurate temperature grid. The graph wont look as pretty, but analysis of cardinal temperatures will be more accurate (which is the one that matters).
```{r, fig.width=6.5,fig.height=6.5}
data<-thermgRad::tg_example
thermgRad::plot_results(data, 0,3,40,38,0,38,2,39, petri=13, toplot= "fluctuation",method="precise")
```
If the dataset to create this plot is required, use the function `thermgRad::grid_results`
